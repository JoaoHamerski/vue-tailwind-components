# vue-tailwind-components

## 🚀 Motivation
I decided to group together a few common components to use on individual projects, aiming on make it light, consistent and harmonic. 

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create flexible components, independent of each other
- Make it strongly typed using TypeScript
- Build consistent interfaces for light and dark themes
- Integrate with semantic color names to make it easy to be themed

## 📋 Basic usage
- Requirements: [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/), [TailwindCSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/) [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/) and [DaisyUI 4](https://daisyui.com/) (optional in some components)
- Each component and its subcomponents are wrapped in a directory
- Copy the component directory from `./src/components` 
- Copy the type declaration file from `./src/types`
- The main component starts with `App` prefix
