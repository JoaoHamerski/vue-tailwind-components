# vue-tailwind-components

## 🚀 Motivation
I created this project due to the lack of consistent, flexible, and harmonic Vue components. It uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) to reduce the boilerplate of writing classes and [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/) to more complex interactive components. Additionaly, it also uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to create visual use cases of the components.  

This project doesn't aim on being a "awesome disruptive package", just an alternative for Vue components.

## 🎯 Objective 
To create a flexibile set of functional pre-built components, independently of each other, where you can copy what you want and change what you wish.

## 📋 Basic usage
- Ensure you've installed the dependencies: Vue 3, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI (optional in some components).
- Just copy the component folder from `src/components/`, its type declaration from `src/types` and paste into your project.
- You may need to update some imports if they don't follow the same project structure.
